# demo-doc-converter

This demo application is made to reproduce a bug on the [jodconverter](https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter) library.

[Issue Link](https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter/issues/320) 

To check the bug, switch the spring-boot version to the latest 3.0.0. Then you can't run the application.
But if you changed the version to 2.7.x or below, it doesn't show any issue.
